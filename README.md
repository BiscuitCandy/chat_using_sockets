# Project_1
- The following project contains three files
- - The chat server - server.py
- - The chat client - client.py
- - A readme file - README.md
#### Implementation
- Both server and client programs are written in python programming language
### Usage
- server.py 
- - >python3 server.py
- - When server.py is run, it prints the server host address and port number, which are used by client to connect to the server
- client.py
- - >python3 client.py <server_host> <server_port> 
- - Once the connection is established between client and server, the client can exchange messages with other clients connected to the server.
- `exit` command can be used to disconnect the client from the server
